# Mood Hair Studio - Website Project
### Project Overview
**Design and build a single page website to promote services.**

Mood Hair Studio is based in Drury, and went through a rebrand in 2019. After they had done this, they approached Signal Boost about creating a website to match. They only wanted a simple solution, one that listed their services while also encouraging click through to their existing booking platform.
